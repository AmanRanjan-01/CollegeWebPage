    <h1>IT INFRASTRUCTURE</h1>
    <p>IIIT-NR has truly world class, campus-wide state of the art information technology tools that are designed to
        meet the computing and communication needs of the institute, which has a fast, reliable and rugged computer
        network of more than 700 Nodes. In order to facilitate proper teaching aid, all classrooms here are equipped
        with projectors and audio systems and has two smart classrooms. All the hostels, cafeteria, academic block,
        guest house, multipurpose hall and residences, are connected through redundant 10 gigabit fiber backbone
        network. All the blocks are connected through layer 2 & 3 switches to provide 1Gbps connectivity at the user
        end. Wireless network with 84 indoor access points to give total campus Wi-Fi coverage. All traffic for internet
        both inbound and outbound passes though 1+1 redundant UTM.
        <br>
        Internet Access: Through a 500 Mbps Internet leased line from PGCIL ( In ring Arctiticture) with an active to
        active connection of 100 Mbps from NKN. Internet connection range is provided through both LAN and Wi-Fi in all
        blocks inclusive of residences, academic, dinning and hostels.

    <p><b> Centre:</b>Data IIIT-NR has a full-fledged data center of its own. It hosts 5 half blade form factor Inten XEON servers in a 16 slot chassis and has network unified storage of 35 TB. The datacentre is powered by redundant 100KVA UPS with N+1 backup.  All servers are connected to Internet by public IPs</p>
    <p<b>Virtual machines on cloud: -</b>  The Institute has VMware Venter cluster perpetual licenses. VM cluster is formed with 1 Physical server failover configuration with total computation power of 80 CPU cores and 1TB of RAM.  All logical servers are created on top VM hypervisor which is managed by Venter server, this setup is a private cloud setup for IIIT-NR usage. Date of all virtual machines are kept at SAN and are backed up weekly using VMware EMC backup system.Institute also uses open source  ProxMox Hypervisor in cluster for one Xeon server dedicated for under grad students project</p>
