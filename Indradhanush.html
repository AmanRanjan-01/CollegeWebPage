    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>Indradhanush as the name suggests is a club made to add colours to<br> the routinely college life. So that creativity follows right behind logic,<br> symmentry and expression. Indradhanush is a cultural club of the<br> institute and is behind the beautiful artistic work behind every event.<br> This club works on the power of imagination and visualisation which is a strong primary requirement even while working with codes. <br> club recognises the need of human to express ideas to upgrade living standards.<br>

        In a technical institute like ours we aim at bringing out the hidden artists in IIIT-NR. <br>We bring together all forms of art- digital art, canvas painting, pencil art, mandala art, pen art, doodling and the list goes on.<br> We're also a bridge that connects art to craft. To name a few craft work that artists in the club practice are quilling, origami and handicraft.</p>
