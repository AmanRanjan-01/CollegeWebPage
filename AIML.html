    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>We were born in the age of internet and are now evolving to the age of<br> Artificial Intelligence, and here is where we develop it. Here in the AI/ML club,<br> we learn how to go from an admirer of this new technology to a capable and complete developer in this new technology. <br>We will build projects from scratch with open source tools like TensorFlow and<br> Keras with application development in Python environments, all while<br> attending competitions, hackathons and maybe even contributing to<br> the open source technology that we work with!</p>
