    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>The Society of Coders is IIIT-Naya Raipur's official coding club. Started<br> by students in a bid to spur the coding culture at this fledging college,<br> the club is responsible for hosting and conducting a diverse range of <br>coding events - hackathons, workshops, coding competitions and <br>much more. We aim to acquaint students with the various facets of <br>coding, with special emphasis on doing things rather than learning<br> things. It also serves as a forum for people to share their ideas,<br> thoughts and ambitions regarding programming in an encouraging and<br> conducive environment. It's a club which welcomes everyone from first <br>time coders to experienced veterans of the trade.</p>
